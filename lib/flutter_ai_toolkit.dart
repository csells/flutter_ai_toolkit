/// Computes the dot product of two embedding vectors represented as lists of

/// language processing tasks, such as computing similarity between
/// embeddings.
///
/// [e1] is the first vector, represented as a List<double>. [e2] is the
/// second vector, represented as a List<double>.

/// Both input vectors must have the same length. If they don't, this method
/// will throw a RangeError when accessing elements.

/// Returns a double representing the dot product of the two input vectors.
